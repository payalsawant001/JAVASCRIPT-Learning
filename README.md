This repository contains my JavaScript learning and practice work, covering fundamental concepts such as variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, and problem-solving exercises. It reflects my consistent effort to strengthen core JavaScript skills and improve logical thinking while building small practical implementations.
